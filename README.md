## What & Why
Every generation has its own unique connection to the arts. Now more than ever, people define their identities by preferences that form a curated ~aesthetic~. These preferences include those of fashion, cuisine, and (arguably most importantly) music. Vast online communities have been formed through the sharing of tastes, and the association between these tastes and certain lifestyles.

SoundTrack is a web application that tracks users’ listening history across different locations. The app brings users together based on common places that they frequent, and the music they associate with these places by creating playlists of songs posted at these locations.

Next time you’re in a cozy cafe, a dark-academia library, or your favorite museum, make yourself the **main character** and pull up a perfectly tailored playlist curated by like-minded peers. Live life to your own soundTrack. 

## For Whom?
Audience: target people 18-34 years olds. SoundTrack is made for music enthusiasts who would like to share their songs and playlists with friends, acquaintances, or the public. Moreover, soundTrack provides an opportunity to form new connections and have shared experiences with unexpected peers so, maybe, big cities like New York can feel a little less lonely. 

## How?
1. Notification goes off.
2. The user posts a song or a playlist, and (optionally) a picture.
3. The song, picture, and location of the user are added to their profile (which can be made private).  
4. Application makes playlists for different places based on songs that users post at that location.

Ambitious: Application suggests friends based on similar listening habits. 

## Scope
